# LED-Modes-Control
The 8 LED Control can be configured by 3 modes: PWM, Strobe, and Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)
PWM: The light turns ON based on the duty cycle
Strobe: the light moves from right to left 
LFSR: The input (current light serial output is the input for the next XNOR operation)
